2. About how to implement new models / new dataloader / new training logic, etc., check documentation first.

3. We do not answer general machine learning / computer vision questions that are not specific to cvpods, such as how a model works, how to improve your training/make it converge, or what algorithm/methods can be used to achieve X.
