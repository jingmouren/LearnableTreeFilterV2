## ðŸš€ Feature
A clear and concise description of the feature proposal.


## Motivation & Examples

Tell us why the feature is useful.

Describe what the feature would look like, if it is implemented.
Best demonstrated using **code examples** in addition to words.

## Note

We only consider adding new features if they are relevant to many users.

If you request implementation of research papers --
we only consider papers that have enough significance and prevalance in the object detection field.

We do not take requests for most projects in the `projects/` directory,
because they are research code release that is mainly for other researchers to reproduce results.

Instead of adding features inside cvpods,
you can implement many features by [Extend cvpodsâ€™s Defaults](https://luoshu.iap.wh-a.brainpp.cn/docs/cvpods/en/latest/tutorials/extend.html).
The [projects/](https://git-core.megvii-inc.com/zhubenjin/cvpods/tree/master/projects) directory contains many of such examples.
